## A little bit about myself...
Hi there! My name is Adrian Ronquillo, and I'm a UI engineer at Netflix! 

## Experience
- ### Software Engineer / Intern 💻: 
    For the summer of 2021, I worked with Metronet - a fiber optic telecommunication company based in Evansville, Indiana. My task was to help design the user interface for the field technicians, and that involved technologies such as NodeJS, React, Typescript, GraphQL, React Storybooks, Github, and SOAP APIs. My most notable achievement at MetroNet was creating a QuickPay feature that reduced payments in-store by over 40%, leading to freed up time for receptionists.
- ### Programming Teaching Assistant 👨🏽‍🏫:
    I have two year's experiecnce of being a computer science teaching assistant. What I do is grade student programs and answer Java programming and object-oriented programming questions, often working with the students themselves and guiding them.
- ### Residential Assistant 👮🏽‍♂️:
    While not being related to programming, I've developed strong teamwork and communication skills by being an RA, which are soft skills that are valuable in the programming world.
    
## Projects
### Storytime
Storytime is an interactive story-making website where you can create an account and then get started making stories with friends. Technologies that were involved were React and Firebase.
